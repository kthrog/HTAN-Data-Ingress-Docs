# Selecting a Storage Platform

The DCC provides dataset storage on the cloud, hosted by __Amazon Web Services (AWS)__ or __Google Cloud (GC)__. 
Your center may decide where to store datasets depending on existing contracts, dataset location, or other preferences. 

The DCC supports dataset transfers to both Amazon and Google clouds via the Synapse platform. If you do not already have an account, [please register for a Synapse account](https://www.synapse.org/#!RegisterAccount:0) using your institutional email address.

Next, please provide your Synapse username and indicate your cloud platform preference to your DCC liaison. You can indicate a cloud platform of your choice, however the DCC recommends the following options:

- if your center's data is already stored on premises/local machines, select AWS as your storage option

- if your center's data is already stored on AWS, select AWS as your storage option and also provide your AWS storage region

- if your center's data is already stored on GC, select GC as your storage option

__Once you determine your dataset storage platform and provide Synapse username(s), your DCC liaison will boot-up the required cloud infrastructure and authorize you to transfer data into a private storage location.__
